## Motivation:

My main motivation behind making this project was to work with React routes and dynamic data handling. there are only three pages. the first page has static data which is the home page. the second page is child page which has dynamic data which load according to the choice you made on the parent. The third page is the content page which include the content and that is rendered according to the choice on parent page plus on the second page.

## Technologies Used
I have build this website with React. For styling I have used css for styling and made the website comic book styled.
